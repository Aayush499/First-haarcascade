# First-haarcascade

Just my first venture into using haarcascade and creating my own cascade files

Just run the python file with all the other folders. The code should recognize any photos from the driver's seat.

Keep in mind, I only trained with about 40 positive and 600 negative images so it's not foolproof by an stretch.

Have fun.
